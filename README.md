### Project Title
Bikeshare Data Explorer

### Description
Bikeshare Data Explorer is an interactive Python application designed to analyze bikeshare usage in three major US cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington. Users can filter the data by city, month, and day of the week to explore various aspects such as:
- Most frequent travel times
- Popular start and end stations
- Trip duration statistics
- User demographics

The program also provides an option to display raw data in increments for a closer look at the dataset.

### Files used
- **bikeshare.py**: Main Python script containing all the analysis logic.
- **chicago.csv**: Dataset for Chicago bikeshare information.
- **new_york_city.csv**: Dataset for New York City bikeshare information.
- **washington.csv**: Dataset for Washington bikeshare information.
- **README.md**: This file.

### Credits
- Inspired by the Udacity Bikeshare Data Analysis project.
- Data provided by the official bikeshare programs of Chicago, New York City, and Washington.
- Special thanks to the Python, Pandas, and NumPy communities for their excellent tools and documentation.
