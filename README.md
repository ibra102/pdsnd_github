### Project Title
US Bikeshare Data Analysis

### Description
This project is an interactive Python application that analyzes US bikeshare data for three major cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington. The program allows users to filter data by city, month, and day of the week. It then displays statistics on the most frequent times of travel, popular stations and trips, trip duration statistics, and user demographics. Additionally, users can opt to view raw data in increments of five rows.

### Files used
- **bikeshare.py** - Main Python script containing the application logic.
- **chicago.csv** - Data file for Chicago bikeshare data.
- **new_york_city.csv** - Data file for New York City bikeshare data.
- **washington.csv** - Data file for Washington bikeshare data.
- **README.md** - This README file.

### Credits
- Project inspired by the Udacity Bikeshare Data Analysis project.
- Data provided by the respective city bikeshare programs.
- Thanks to the Python, Pandas, and NumPy communities for their excellent tools and documentation.
